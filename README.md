# my-100-day-chalenge
  <h2>Hey, guysâœŒ</h2>
    <p>
      I started a 100-day challenge to improve coding skills and better
      understand programming. All my daily project files will be uploaded to
      this repository
    </p>
    <p>
      I follow the mini-projects of this repository online courses from
      educational sites and YouTube. I will share the links for you as well.
